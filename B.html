    <h1>  What Was I Made For? </h1>

        <br>
        Mmm, mmm <br>
        Mmm<br>
        <br>

    I used to float, now I just fall down <br>
    I used to know, but I'm not sure now <br>
    What I was made for<br>
    What was I made for?<br>
<br>
    Taking a drive, I was an ideal<br>
    Looked so alive, turns out, I'm not real<br>
    Just something you paid for<br>
    What was I made for?<br>
    <br>

    Mmm<br>
    <br>

    'Cause I, I<br>
    I don't know how to feel<br>
    But I wanna try<br>
    I don't know how to feel<br>
    But someday I might<br>
    Someday I might<br>
    <br>

    Mmm, mmm, ah-mmm<br>
    Mmm, mmm, mmm<br>
    <br>

    When did it end? All the enjoyment<br>
    I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend<br>
    It's not what he's made for<br>
    What was I made for?<br>
    <br>

    'Cause I, 'cause I<br>
    I don't know how to feel<br>
    But I wanna try<br>
    I don't know how to feel<br>
    But someday I might<br>
    Someday I might<br>
    <br>

    Think I forgot how to be happy<br>
    Something I'm not, but something I can be<br>
    Something I wait for<br>
    Something I'm made for<br>
    Something I'm made for<br>
        </p>
